# ToonTown Rewritten API Scripts

This repository contains scripts used to call the ToonTown Rewritten (TTR) REST API. Currently, functionality is being built to call the 'invasions' endpoint and display the current 'districts' being invaded, which cog (i.e. Enemy) is invading, and the progress on the invasion (i.e. time left). 

Plans are in place to expand the scripts to include using other endpoints available such as 'district populations', 'field-offices', 'doodles', and 'silly-meter'.
